    "### Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the dynamics of urban living is useful for policymakers, businesses, and individuals considering relocation. By analyzing key factors that contribute to the quality of life in cities, we can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different urban environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering cities based on numerical `\"well-being metrics\"` like such as:\n",
    "* `Purchase Power`\n",
    "* `Health Care`\n",
    "* `Pollution`\n",
    "* `Quality of Life`\n",
    "* `Crime Rating`\n",
    "* the price of a `Cappuccino`, `Wine`, `Gasoline`\n",
    "* `Avg_Rent`, and\n",
    "* `Avg_Disposable_Income`\n",
    "\n",
    "allows us to identify patterns and group cities with similar characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing any clusters that we find, this can help people wanting to move make informed decisions about where to live, where to invest, and how to improve urban conditions. The results of such clustering can provide a foundation for further analysis and strategic planning in urban development.\n",
