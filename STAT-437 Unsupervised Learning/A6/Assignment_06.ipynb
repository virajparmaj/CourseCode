    "##  Seattle Airbnb Listing Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you work as a data scientist at Airbnb. You'd like to learn more about the main different types of Airbnb listings in the Seattle area and then use this information to advertise these different types of listings to interested customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following dataset is a sample of available Airbnb listings in Seattle, WA. These listings were collected in January 2016, and filtered to just contain listings from some of the most popular Seattle neighborhoods (for Airbnb listings) and just contain listings that are either in a house or apartment property. Rows with missing values have already been dropped from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the following variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Listing Information**\n",
    "The dataset contains the following information about the Airbnb *listing*:\n",
    "* <u>price</u>: price of the listing (per night)(in US dollars)\n",
    "* <u>review_scores_rating</u>: the average rating of the listing [0,100] (100 is the best)\n",
    "* <u>number_of_reviews</u>: the number of reviews for the listing\n",
    "* <u>security_deposit</u>: the security deposit required for the listing (in US dollars)\n",
    "* <u>cleaning_fee</u>: the cleaning fee required for the listing (in US dollars)\n",
    "* <u>neighborhood</u>: the neighborhood of Seattle the listing is located in\n",
    "* <u>property_type</u>: is the listing in a 'House' or 'Apartment'\n",
    "* <u>room_type</u>: is the listing a 'Entire home/apt', 'Private room', or 'Shared room'\n",
    "* <u>accommodates</u>: how many guests will the listing accommodate\n",
    "* <u>bathrooms</u>:how many bathrooms does the listing have\n",
    "* <u>beds</u>: how many beds does the listing have\n",
    "\n",
    "**Host Information**\n",
    "The dataset also contains the following information about the *host* of the given Airbnb listing:\n",
    "* <u>host_is_superhost</u>: is the host a \"superhost\": t=True, f=False\n",
    "* <u>host_has_profile_pic</u>: does the host have a profile pic in their bio: t=True, f=False\n",
    "* <u>host_response_time</u>: how fast will the host respond to requests (on average)\n",
    "* <u>host_acceptance_rate</u>: what percent of booking requests will the host accept\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Case Study 1</u>: Reduced Dataset - *Just Categorical Variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment 6, we would like to try clustering our Airbnb listing dataset for now using just the categorical variables. In assignment 7 we will consider the full dataset which will use the categorical and the numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Research Goals</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we have the following research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify larger \"main clusters\" of Airbnb listings in the Seattle area. In general, we would like for most of our listings to be clustered in with a larger sized clusters, rather than be separated as small or singleton clusters.\n",
    "2. We would also like to identify potential sub-clusters of listings within each of the \"main clusters.\"\n",
    "3. What attributes characterize each of these clusters and sub-clusters?"
