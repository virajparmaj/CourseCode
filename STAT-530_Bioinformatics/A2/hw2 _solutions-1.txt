Instructions:
####################
Read the paper by Vanrobaeys et al. (2023) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41715-7 and available on Canvas), and answer the following questions in ONE SENTENCE. Write your answer directly into this text document below each question.

Each question is worth 2 points. You can use whatever resources you'd like, including AI. In my experience, AI-generated answers will be correct, but very broad and general. You will get 1 point if your answer is correct and 2 points if your answer clearly demonstrates true understanding of this specific paper and biological context.

####################
Question 1 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we talked about how the main question of this paper is to understand the "activity-driven spatial transcriptomic diversity within the hippocampal network".

a. Why is this important? (2 points)

It can help us understand how memories are physically written into the brain.

b. What major issues with previous studies into this topic are addressed by this study? (2 points)

Previous studies only looked at specific genes but this one looks at all genes (takes an unbiased approach).

####################
Question 2 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "What genes become up- and down-regulated as a result of spatial object recognition (SOR) training?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

101 genes were significantly up-regulated and 18 were significantly down-regulated.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

How similar are these DEGs to those that might be involved in consolidation of a different type of (non-spatial) memory?

####################
Question 3 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "What biological processes are involved in SOR training?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

Multiple processes, including nuclear receptor and nucleotide transmembrane transporter activity, were found to be involved.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

These processes are very generic, how can they be involved in such a specific mechanism of memory consolidation?

####################
Question 4 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "How consistent are the pseudobulk and bulk RNA-seq results?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

They are statistically significantly consistent.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

The results are still pretty different, which one should we trust?

####################
Question 5 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "To what extent are spatially distinct subregions of the hippocampus also transcriptionally distinct?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

Different physical regions appear far apart on a UMAP based on their transcriptional profiles.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

Why were the stratum radiatum and the stratum oriens previously identified as separate regions if the transcriptomic difference between them is not that big?

####################
Question 6 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "What genes and processes are involved in the different spatial subregions due to SOR training?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

There were 46, 13, 68, 9, and 10 DEGs found in the CA1, CA2 + CA3, dentate gyrus, stratum oriens, and stratum radiatum, respectively.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

Is the dentate gyrus especially active during memory consolidation?

####################
Question 7 (4 points)
####################
In lecture we discussed the analysis of the question "What cells types in the dorsal hippocampus are responsible for upregulation of Sgk1 after learning?"

a. Summarize the results of this analysis. (2 points)

Oligodendrocytes seemed to be especially active.

b. Given the results, suggest a new biological question that would be meaningful. (2 points)

Are oligodendrocytes especially numerous in the CA1?
